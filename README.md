# Mini Portfolio

This is my first mini portfolio project built using **HTML and CSS**.  

## Technologies I used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox, responsive layout)
- Fonts and colors customized for professional look

## How I Made It
I structured the page using semantic HTML and styled it with CSS.  
I used Flexbox to align navigation links and project cards.  
Hover effects, colors, and fonts were customized to make the layout modern and clean.
Read and watched few internet resources.
